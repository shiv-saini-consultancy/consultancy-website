    <p>
        Merchant banking plays a pivotal role in India’s financial ecosystem, serving as a catalyst
        for economic growth, capital mobilization, and corporate restructuring. Merchant bankers
        provide advisory, underwriting, and capital-raising services that support businesses and
        capital markets.
    </p>

    <h3>The Role of Merchant Bankers</h3>

    <h3>Capital Market Advisory</h3>
    <p>
        Merchant bankers assist companies with IPOs, FPOs, rights issues, and QIPs by ensuring
        regulatory compliance, efficient pricing, and strong investor participation.
    </p>

    <h3>Underwriting</h3>
    <p>
        By underwriting new securities, merchant bankers ensure successful capital raising by
        assuming the risk of unsold securities.
    </p>

    <h3>Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)</h3>
    <p>
        They provide advisory services for mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructuring,
        including valuation, negotiations, and due diligence.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Financing & Debt Restructuring</h3>
    <p>
        Merchant bankers assist in project financing and help distressed companies restructure
        debt to restore financial stability.
    </p>

    <h3>Regulatory Framework</h3>
    <p>
        Merchant banking in India is regulated by SEBI, ensuring transparency, investor protection,
        and ethical conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
        Merchant bankers play a vital role in capital market development, efficient capital
        allocation, and corporate governance, making them indispensable to India’s financial system.
